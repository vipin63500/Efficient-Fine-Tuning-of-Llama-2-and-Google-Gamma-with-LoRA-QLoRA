# Efficient-Fine-Tuning-of-Llama-2-and-Google-Gamma-with-LoRA-QLoRA

This project demonstrates the fine-tuning of the Llama-2 model using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Quantized LoRA (QLoRA). The goal is to optimize this large language model for specific tasks while reducing computational costs and maintaining high performance.

***Project Structure***
data/: Contains the datasets used for training and evaluation.
models/: Directory where the pre-trained and fine-tuned models are stored.
scripts/: Python scripts for fine-tuning, evaluation, and deployment.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for experiments, analysis, and visualizations.
results/: Outputs from the fine-tuning process, including metrics and checkpoints.

***Requirements***
Python 3.x
PyTorch
Hugging Face Transformers
LoRA/QLoRA libraries
FAISS (for text embedding, if applicable)

**Fine-Tuning Process**
Llama-2
Load Pre-trained Model: Use Hugging Face Transformers to load the pre-trained Llama-2 model.
Apply LoRA: Implement LoRA to enable efficient parameter adaptation.
Training: Fine-tune the model on your dataset using the provided script.
Apply QLoRA: Implement QLoRA for quantized fine-tuning if desired.
Evaluation: Assess the performance of the fine-tuned model on a test set.
